### How to run
##### Pre-requisites
(If you want to run it on local machine(without docker)
- python 3 installed
- pip installed 

Run the below command to execute
- Install the dependecies
``` pip install -r requirement.txt ```
- Run below command to execute
``` python report.py ```

## How to run with docker
I have setup docker-compose file which you can run it directly
For this, we need to have docker (and docker-compose) installed
Run the command below

``` docker-compose up ```

This will downlaod all the rependecies internally and run and prints the report.
